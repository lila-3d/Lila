/**
 * Paint layer data on a texture set: per paint buffer, the strokes painted into it as records (strokes are data) and
 * optionally a flattened baseline of pixels the strokes paint over. The pixels themselves live on the GPU as 128x128
 * pages (render/PaintGpu.h), rebuilt from this data whenever they are missing or out of date, so the data is the truth
 * and the pages are a cache: undo, scene files and re-rasterising at another resolution all go through it.
 *
 * Paint buffers are named by id ("paint1"). The texture graph reads a buffer channel through an image parameter whose
 * value is imageRef(id, channel), "external:paint/<id>/<channel>": an External buffer the live viewport and texture
 * exports supply. Each channel image holds the painted value in rgb (gray channels in r, g and b) and its coverage in a.
 * The channel "mask" is the layer's paint mask, written like any other channel.
 *
 * Until the layer stack lands, buffers are created by texPaintStroke and texPaintLayer and stored here; a layer stack
 * keeps this storage and refers to buffers by id.
