/**
 * Compiling a texture graph into an evaluation plan: the passes to run, in order, each a Slang compute shader (or a
 * native multi-pass node), the buffers they read and write, and the uniform values.
 *
 * Contract every evaluator (the CPU one in Evaluate.h, the GPU one in the renderer) implements for a fused pass:
 *
 *   binding 0  ConstantBuffer<TexPassHeader> gPass   { float4 res;  // width, height, 1/width, 1/height
 *                                                     float4 uv; }  // uv offset xy, uv scale zw (whole texture: 0,0,1,1)
 *   binding 1  StructuredBuffer<float4> gU           Plan::uniforms, with every buffer descriptor slot filled in
 *   binding 2  StructuredBuffer<float4> gArena       every buffer the pass reads, packed anywhere in one array
 *   binding 3  RWStructuredBuffer<float4> gOut       the pass's output buffer, row-major, row 0 at the top (v = 1)
 *   entry "texMain", [numthreads(8, 8, 1)], dispatched over ceil(width / 8) x ceil(height / 8) groups.
 *
 * A buffer descriptor slot (BufferDesc::slot) holds asuint(arena offset in texels), asuint(width), asuint(height), 0,
 * written by the evaluator once it has placed the buffers. Texel (x, y) of a pass covers
 * uv = gPass.uv.xy + ((x + 0.5) / width, 1 - (y + 0.5) / height) * gPass.uv.zw; sampling a buffer is bilinear and wraps.
 *
 * Values never reach the source: parameters and unlinked inputs are read from gU, so a value edit keeps every pass's
 * source and Plan::structureHash, and only the uniforms change. A link, node or type change gives a new hash, and so does
 * a code parameter's edit (the Pixel Processor's expression), which is spliced into the source.
