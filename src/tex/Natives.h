/**
 * Native (multi-pass) texture nodes: blur, flood fill, distance, dilate, erode, ambient occlusion and normal to height.
 * Each has a C++ implementation the CPU evaluator runs, and a GPU form: Slang kernels in
 * <resources>/texnodes/natives/<file>.slang run in the order nativeSchedule() gives.
 *
 * GPU contract for one native pass. Its frame buffers, by index: the node's inputs in declaration order, then its
 * output, then the schedule's scratch buffers (rgba32f, their own sizes). Every step is one compute dispatch of
 * nativeKernelSource(file, entry), entry "texMain", [numthreads(8, 8, 1)], with the same four bindings as a fused pass
 * (Plan.h):
 *
 *   binding 0  gPass   res = the step's output buffer size (w, h, 1/w, 1/h); uv = NativeStep::constants (kernels take
 *                      the gU slots of the buffers a step reads from here)
 *   binding 1  gU      nativeFrame(): descriptors (asuint offset, width, height, 0) of the inputs and the output, then
 *                      each parameter in declaration order taking paramSlots(type) slots, then the scratch descriptors
 *   binding 2  gArena  every frame buffer, read
 *   binding 3  gOut    the step's output buffer (frame index NativeStep::output), written; a step never reads it
 *
 * dispatched over ceil(threadsX / 8) x ceil(threadsY / 8) groups. Steps run in order with a barrier between them. The
 * GPU result matches the CPU one within float tolerance, except flood fill, whose GPU sweeps are exact for regions they
 * converge on (any region a few row/column turns across, so bricks, tiles and cells) and the distance node, which is a
 * jump flood on the GPU and exact on the CPU. Flood fill data stores texel offsets: exact in rgba16f up to 2048 px.
