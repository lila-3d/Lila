/**
 * The layer stack: a Painter-style view over a texture set's graph, never a second system. Every stack edit compiles the
 * whole stack into the set's texGraph:
 *
 *   - each layer is a Group node (named by its id, "L3") whose subgroup makes the layer's channel values and its mask;
 *   - per channel, a chain of layerBlend nodes composites the layers bottom to top (layerBlendNormal for normals, RNM);
 *   - heights composite before height-to-normal, whose result is RNM-blended onto the composited normals;
 *   - the stack itself is stored on the Material Output node (values.layerStack), with stable ids.
 *
 * Reading the stack back (readStack) takes that metadata, picks up value edits made in the graph (blend modes, opacities,
 * fill values, generator settings: everything the stack has a field for) and recompiles; when the result differs from the
 * graph, the set was edited as nodes in a way the stack can't show and is in graph mode until rebuilt.
 *
 * Layer kinds: fill (a material and a mask), paint (placeholder material plus paint buffers per channel and a painted mask,
 * filled by the painting tools), procedural (any graph whose outputs are named after channels, optionally "mask"), folder
 * (children composited over the stack below, then mixed in through the folder's mask), instance (another layer's values
 * and mask, so one painted mask feeds several places) and filter (a filter node applied to the composite below).
 *
 * Masks stack bottom to top on 0 (on 1 when a layer has none): fill (a value), generator (a mask graph over mesh maps),
 * filter and levels (applied to the masks below), paint (an image) and anchor (a channel of the composite at an anchor).
 * An anchor is a name on a layer for the composite right after it; masks and generator inputs of layers above read it.
