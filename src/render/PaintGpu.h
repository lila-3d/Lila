/**
 * GPU paint buffers: each texture set paint buffer (tex/PaintStrokes.h) as RGBA16F pages of 128x128 texels per channel
 * and UDIM tile, allocated on first touch from shared page pools (an untouched page costs nothing). The pages are a cache
 * of the set's paint data: sync rasterises whatever the data has that the pages lack (a scene just opened, an undo past a
 * flatten, a new resolution) by replaying stroke records deterministically.
 *
 * A stroke copies each page it first touches (copy on write): the copy is painted, the original is kept as the stroke's
 * "before" and blended from, and undo swaps the two back, so undo memory is proportional to the pages a stroke touched and
 * restores them bit for bit. Strokes paint per texel by 3D distance to each dab over the surface position the texel's UV
 * raster gives it (and padding texels the nearest edge's), test the stroke view's depth and facing, and write all of the
 * payload's channels in one pass.
 *
 * The texture graph reads a channel through an External buffer named tex::paint::externalName(buffer, channel): its
 * image (externalImage) is kept up to date from the pages after every change.
 *
 * Everything here runs on the main thread (GPU work waits for the render thread), except externalImage.
