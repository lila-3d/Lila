/**
 * bakeLint: problems that spoil a bake, found before it runs. bake() lints first and lists what it finds in its warnings.
 *
 *   hardEdges        hard edges that are not UV seams (the normal map can't hide the shading split)
 *   uvOverlap        UV islands overlapping within a texture, including across groups writing the same file
 *   uvMissing        lows without uv0, triangles with no UV area
 *   texelDensity     islands whose texels per cm are far from the project's median
 *   mirroredTangents triangles whose UV winding disagrees with their tangent sign (a mirrored island baked as unmirrored)
 *   highRange        lows whose rays find no high (or few) within the frontal and rear distances
 *   cageContainment  high points outside the cage (beyond frontal) or deeper than rear
 *   triangulation    non-planar faces whose triangles depend on the exporter's split
 *   cageTopology     an editable cage that doesn't match its low
